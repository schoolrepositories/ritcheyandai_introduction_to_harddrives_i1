# Instructions

Create reading materials (an article), and a quiz. Unless otherwise stated, assume the reader will have no prior knowledge on the subject, and make it beginner friendly. Do not use Markdown in the output. Return the content in a blockquote.

## Quiz

The the quiz will be however many questions long I state, and on the topic I state. Each question will be fill in the blank, with one blanked out word, or phrase. Each question will have two potential answers to choose from. One will be correct. The other will be made up. Any key words or terms used in it, must be real sounding, but fictitious. Make sure the correct answer isn't always the same (e.g., not always A), or B), so students have harder time guessing). The quiz must be structured using the format I declare, as it will be parsed by an external tool, and any deviation from the proper structure will cause problems. When following the quiz structure, keep in mind that empty lines are intentionally included.

## Article

After you've created the questions, and answers for the quiz, write an article on the topic, which contains all the information needed to complete the quiz, including the exact words used in the correct quiz answers. 

The article must only use HTML compliant text characters. The article can use HTML elements (e.g. lists, tables, bold text) to help style/format things, but should try to use plain-text where possible.
